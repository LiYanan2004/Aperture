# ``Aperture``

Integrate camera experience into your SwiftUI apps. 

## Overview

Aperture provides a simple SwiftUI solution for developers, with adavanced capture features like zero-shutter lag, responsive capture, and more.

Create a simple camera experience by directly using ``CameraView`` + ``SystemCameraExperience``. Create your own camera experiences inside the view builder closure of ``CameraView``. Apply modifiers to ``CameraView`` to customize capture configurations.
